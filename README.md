## Features
1. **API Integration for Product Management**

   The boilerplate includes API integration for product management, allowing you to perform CRUD operations seamlessly. With this feature, you can easily fetch, create, update, and delete products from your application.

2. **Redux State Management with Persistence**

   Utilizing Redux, the boilerplate provides a state management solution for handling shopping cart data. Redux Persist ensures that the cart data remains intact even after the application is reloaded, providing a smooth and uninterrupted shopping experience for your users.

3. **Dynamic UI Theming with DaisyUI**

   DaisyUI is integrated into the boilerplate to facilitate dynamic UI theming. You can easily switch between pre-defined themes or create your own custom themes in the `tailwind.config.js` file. This feature allows you to customize the UI appearance to match your brand's identity.

4. **Pre-built Components for Stunning UI**

   The boilerplate comes with a collection of pre-built components that are seamlessly integrated with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI. These components help you create visually appealing user interfaces with ease, saving you development time and effort.
